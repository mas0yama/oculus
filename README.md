# oculus
i was just bored and anxios

so... i wrote this.

**oculus** - a tool for making screenshots of url list.

![](oculus.jpg)

based on splinter lib

### Requirments
**IDK lol one can check shell.nix (snitched it somewhere from internet)**


### BUGS
- mmm, screenshot names (cause hardcoded only one and it is overwrites everytime)
- base_url fix (if no / in it then tool crashes)
- if no user-agent switching counter still counts

### TODO:
- NORMAL USAGE LIKE BRO IMPLEMENT ARGS
- ? proxying traffic via tor ?
- some kind of report????
